            <h2>A Showcase of Web Development Work</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my project portfolio! Each project represents hours of careful planning, coding, and refinement. From responsive business websites to interactive web applications, these projects demonstrate my commitment to quality, attention to detail, and passion for creating exceptional user experiences. I approach every project with the same dedication, whether it's a simple landing page or a complex e-commerce platform.</p>

        <!-- Project 1 -->
        <section class="content-section project-card clearfix">
            <h2 class="section-title">Image Editing & Enhancement Project</h2>
            
            <figure class="float-right figure-small">
                <img src="../images/bee-after.webp" alt="Macro photography of a bee on flower">
                <figcaption>Image editing project - enhancing nature photography with precise detail</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <p>This image editing project showcased my skills in digital photo enhancement and manipulation using professional editing software. Working with a collection of nature and wildlife photographs, I applied advanced editing techniques to bring out the best in each image. The bee photograph demonstrates precise color correction, sharpness enhancement, and detail preservation that makes the subject truly pop against its background.</p>
            
            <p>The editing process involved careful adjustment of exposure, contrast, and vibrance to enhance the natural colors without making the images look oversaturated or artificial. I used selective sharpening techniques to bring out fine details like the bee's fuzzy texture and the delicate flower petals, while maintaining a soft, natural bokeh in the background. Color grading was applied to create a cohesive visual style across the entire collection.</p>
            
            <figure class="float-left figure-small">
                <img src="../images/bird-after.webp" alt="Colorful bird macro photography">
                <figcaption>Professional photo enhancement showcasing vibrant colors and detail</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <p>The bird photograph presented unique challenges with its already vibrant plumage. The goal was to enhance the natural colors while maintaining realistic tones. I used layer masking and selective color adjustments to bring out the rich reds, blues, and yellows in the feathers. Noise reduction was applied to smooth out grain from the high ISO capture, while careful sharpening restored crisp detail in the feathers and eye.</p>
            
            <p>This project demonstrates my attention to detail and understanding of color theory, both valuable skills that translate directly to web design. Just as I enhance photographs to guide the viewer's eye and create visual impact, I apply similar principles when designing websites – using color, contrast, and visual hierarchy to create engaging user experiences. The patience and precision required in photo editing mirror the care I take in writing clean, efficient code.</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>This project demonstrates my proficiency with modern CSS layout techniques and JavaScript interactivity. The assignment required creating a responsive image gallery using CSS Grid with five auto-width columns, combined with JavaScript functionality to allow users to change the main display image by clicking on thumbnails. This type of interactive gallery is commonly used in e-commerce sites, portfolio pages, and photo sharing platforms.</p>
            
            <p>The CSS Grid implementation showcases the power and flexibility of modern layout techniques. Using a five-column grid with auto-width columns ensures that images distribute evenly across the available space, automatically adapting to different screen sizes. The grid gap property creates consistent spacing between items, while the grid itself handles all the complex positioning calculations. This approach is much cleaner and more maintainable than older float-based or flexbox workarounds for grid layouts.</p>
            
            <p>The JavaScript component adds interactivity that enhances user experience. When a visitor clicks on any thumbnail image, the changeImage() function dynamically updates the main display area to show the selected image at full size. This was implemented using vanilla JavaScript with event listeners and DOM manipulation, demonstrating my ability to create interactive features without relying on heavy frameworks. The code is clean, efficient, and well-commented for future maintenance.</p>
            
            <p>This project also reinforced important web development principles like separating concerns (HTML for structure, CSS for presentation, JavaScript for behavior), writing semantic markup, and creating accessible interactions. The gallery includes proper alt text for all images, keyboard navigation support, and clear visual feedback when users interact with thumbnails. These details ensure that the gallery works well for all users, regardless of how they access the site.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Interactive HTML Forms with Validation</h2>
            
            <figure class="float-left figure-small">
                <img src="../images/eagle-after.webp" alt="Eagle photography - precision and attention to detail">
                <figcaption>Precision and attention to detail - essential for form development</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <p>This comprehensive form project showcased my ability to create user-friendly, accessible web forms with a wide variety of input types and built-in validation. The assignment required implementing at least ten different HTML5 input types, each serving a specific purpose in collecting user information. This technology survey form demonstrates how thoughtful form design can make data collection both effective and pleasant for users.</p>
            
            <p>The form includes text inputs for names and feedback, email validation to ensure properly formatted addresses, number inputs with min/max constraints for age, date and time pickers for scheduling preferences, URL validation for website submissions, color pickers for favorite color selection, range sliders for satisfaction ratings, radio buttons for single-choice questions, checkboxes for multiple selections, dropdown menus for technology choices, and text areas for detailed comments. Each input type was chosen specifically for its purpose, improving both usability and data quality.</p>
            
            <p>HTML5 validation attributes were implemented throughout the form, including required fields, pattern matching for specific formats, minimum and maximum values for numeric inputs, and appropriate input types that trigger mobile-optimized keyboards. Clear labels, placeholder text, and helpful error messages guide users through the form completion process. The form is fully accessible with proper label associations, keyboard navigation support, and screen reader compatibility.</p>
            
            <p>The styling demonstrates my CSS skills with custom form controls, consistent spacing and alignment, visual feedback for focus states and validation errors, and responsive design that adapts the form layout for mobile devices. This project reinforced the importance of user experience in form design – making forms that people actually want to complete requires careful attention to layout, messaging, and validation feedback. The skills demonstrated here are directly applicable to contact forms, registration systems, checkout processes, and any web application that collects user input.</p>
