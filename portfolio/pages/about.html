            <p>My journey in technology began long before I wrote my first line of code. Growing up in an era of rapid technological change, I was always fascinated by how computers worked and how they could be used to solve problems. This curiosity led me to pursue a career in IT, where I spent years working with various systems, networks, and technologies. However, it was the creative and interactive nature of web development that truly captured my passion and became my professional focus.</p>
            
            <p>Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of wearing many hats – from troubleshooting complex IT issues to designing user interfaces, from managing servers to writing clean, efficient code. This diverse experience has given me a unique perspective on web development. I understand not just the front-end aesthetics that users see, but also the backend systems that power websites, the server configurations that keep them running, and the security measures that protect them.</p>
            
            <p>What drives me every day is the opportunity to create something meaningful. Whether it's a small business website that helps a local entrepreneur reach more customers, or a complex web application that streamlines business processes, I find immense satisfaction in building digital solutions that make a real difference. The web is constantly evolving, and I love being part of an industry where learning never stops and innovation is always around the corner.</p>

        <!-- Professional Background -->
        <section class="content-section clearfix">
            <h2 class="section-title">Professional Background</h2>
            
            <figure class="float-right figure-small">
                <img src="../images/workplace.jpg" alt="IT infrastructure and networking">
                <figcaption>Strong foundation in IT infrastructure and systems</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <p>My professional journey spans multiple facets of information technology, providing me with a comprehensive understanding of how different systems work together. I began my career in IT support, where I developed strong problem-solving skills and learned the importance of clear communication when working with non-technical users. This experience taught me that the best solutions are not just technically sound, but also user-friendly and accessible.</p>
            
            <p>As I progressed in my career, I took on increasingly complex responsibilities, including network administration, system configuration, and security management. These roles deepened my understanding of how web applications interact with underlying infrastructure and reinforced the importance of building robust, scalable solutions. I learned that successful web development requires thinking beyond the code itself to consider performance, security, and maintainability.</p>
            
            <p>The transition to web development felt natural as it combined my technical skills with creative problem-solving. I started with HTML and CSS, building simple websites and learning the fundamentals of web design. From there, I expanded into JavaScript, responsive design, and modern web frameworks. Each new skill opened up new possibilities, and I found myself increasingly drawn to the creative aspects of development while maintaining the systematic approach from my IT background.</p>
            
            <p>Today, I bring this blend of IT expertise and web development skills to every project. Whether I'm optimizing database queries, configuring deployment pipelines, or designing responsive layouts, I approach each challenge with both technical precision and creative thinking. My background in IT also means I understand the business side of technology – I know how to balance ideal solutions with practical constraints like budgets, timelines, and existing infrastructure.</p>

            <p>In the fast-paced world of web development, staying current is not just beneficial – it's essential. I'm committed to continuous learning and regularly engage with the developer community through online courses, tutorials, and industry publications. Currently, I'm enrolled in web development courses that cover everything from HTML5 and CSS3 fundamentals to advanced JavaScript and responsive design techniques.</p>
            
            <p>Beyond formal education, I believe in learning by doing. I regularly work on personal projects that allow me to experiment with new technologies and techniques in a low-pressure environment. These projects serve as both learning opportunities and portfolio pieces, demonstrating my ability to adapt and grow with the industry. I also contribute to open-source projects when possible, which helps me learn from other developers and give back to the community that has taught me so much.</p>

        <!-- Personal Philosophy -->

            <h2 class="section-title">My Development Philosophy</h2>
            
            <figure class="figure-full">
                <img src="../images/hiking-image.jpg" alt="User-centered design process">

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Code with Purpose</h3>
                <p>Every line of code should serve a purpose. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code that other developers can understand and build upon. Good code is not just about functionality – it's about clarity, efficiency, and long-term sustainability.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Design for Humans</h3>
                <p>Technology should serve people, not the other way around. I design with accessibility and usability at the forefront, ensuring that websites work for everyone, regardless of their device, browser, or abilities. A beautiful website that's difficult to use serves no one.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Build with Integrity</h3>
                <p>Trust is earned through consistency and reliability. I take deadlines seriously, communicate openly about progress and challenges, and stand behind my work. When I commit to a project, I'm committed to seeing it succeed.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>These principles guide every project I undertake. Whether I'm building a simple landing page or a complex web application, I approach each task with the same dedication to quality and user experience. The web is a powerful tool for connection, communication, and commerce, and I'm honored to play a part in shaping how people interact with it.</p>

        <!-- Outside of Work -->
        <section class="content-section clearfix">
            <h2 class="section-title">Beyond the Code</h2>
            
            <figure class="float-left figure-small">
                <img src="../images/gaming-image.jpeg" alt="Gaming and technology passion">
                <figcaption>Gaming provides both relaxation and creative inspiration</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <p>While web development is my professional passion, I believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Outside of coding, I'm an avid gamer, which actually connects to my development work in interesting ways. Gaming has taught me about user experience, engagement mechanics, and the importance of responsive feedback – all valuable lessons that translate directly to web development. The attention to detail required in competitive gaming mirrors the precision needed in writing quality code.</p>
            
            <p>I also enjoy hiking and spending time outdoors, which provides a necessary counterbalance to the hours spent in front of screens. There's something therapeutic about being in nature that helps clear my mind and often leads to creative solutions for problems I've been working on. Some of my best ideas have come to me while walking through the woods, far from any computer.</p>
            
            <p>These interests outside of development make me a more well-rounded professional. They provide perspective, prevent burnout, and often inspire creative approaches to technical challenges. I believe the best developers are those who bring diverse experiences and perspectives to their work, and I strive to be that kind of developer.</p>
