### Repetition
- Consistent step badge design
- Repeated page header format
- Uniform box styling (warnings, tips, components)
- Same font hierarchy throughout
- Checklist format for completions

### Alignment
- Left-aligned body text
- Justified paragraphs
- Grid layout for component boxes
- Aligned table of contents dots
- Consistent margins (0.75")

### Proximity
- Related substeps grouped together
- Information boxes near relevant content
- Component descriptions in grid
- Step intro boxes clearly separated
- Logical flow from prep to completion

## Next Steps to Complete the Project

### 1. Merge HTML Files
The guide is split into two files for easier editing. You need to combine them:

**Option A - Manual Merge:**
1. Open `gaming-pc-guide.html` in a text editor
2. Find the closing `</body></html>` tags at the end
3. Open `guide-pages-16-24.html` and copy everything AFTER the opening comment
4. Paste it into `gaming-pc-guide.html` BEFORE the closing `</body></html>` tags
5. Save as `gaming-pc-guide-complete.html`

**Option B - Use the Combined File (I'll create this for you)**

### 2. Add Images

You have three options for images:

**Option A - Use Royalty-Free Images:**
- Unsplash.com (completely free, no attribution required)
- Pexels.com (free stock photos)
- Search for: "gaming PC", "computer components", "motherboard", "GPU installation"

**Option B - Create Your Own:**
- Take photos if you have access to PC components
- Use Canva.com to create diagrams
- Use Microsoft PowerPoint to create labeled diagrams

**Option C - Use Screenshot Tools:**
- Screenshot BIOS screens from YouTube videos (educational fair use)
