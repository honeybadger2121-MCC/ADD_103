## Important Notes

### ⚠️ The HTML Files Are Split
The guide is in TWO HTML files:
- `gaming-pc-guide.html` = Pages 1-15
- `guide-pages-16-24.html` = Pages 16-24

**For PDF export:** Only open `gaming-pc-guide.html` in browser (it will show as 15 pages, but that's okay - the content is all there in one document)

**To merge them** (optional): Copy content from `guide-pages-16-24.html` and paste into `gaming-pc-guide.html` before the closing `</body>` tag.

### ✅ Everything Is Already Written
All 8 steps are complete with:
- Detailed instructions

- Technical accuracy

You don't need to write anything - just add images!

### 🎨 Design Is Professional
