    <p><strong>Columbus Day</strong>, commemorated on the second Monday of October, marks a pivotal moment in world history when <em>Christopher Columbus</em> embarked on his legendary voyage across the Atlantic Ocean in <sub>1492</sub>. This federal holiday celebrates the spirit of exploration and the connections formed between the Old and New Worlds, forever changing the course of human history.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #f39c12; font-style: italic;">The Historic Voyage</h2>

    <div class="navigation-theme">
        <p>With three ships - the <em>Niña</em>, the <em>Pinta</em>, and the <em>Santa María</em> - Columbus and his crew of <sup>90</sup> men set sail from Spain into the unknown. Their journey, spanning more than two months and approximately 4,000 miles of open ocean, marked one of the most significant maritime expeditions in history. Using the stars and primitive navigation tools, they ventured further west than any European had ever sailed before.</p>

    <h3>Legacy and Celebration</h3>

    <div class="historic-quote">
        <p>As recorded in Columbus's journal: <mark>"Following the light of the sun, we left the Old World behind."</mark> This poetic observation captures the essence of his ambitious journey and the dawn of a new era in global exploration and cultural exchange.</p>

    <p>Today, Columbus Day serves as a reminder of humanity's endless quest for knowledge and understanding. While the holiday has evolved to include broader discussions about cultural exchange and historical perspectives, it continues to symbolize the human spirit of exploration and discovery that drives innovation and progress in every field of human endeavor.</p>

    <p>The holiday is celebrated across America with parades, festivals, and educational events that highlight both maritime history and Italian-American heritage. Schools often use this occasion to teach students about navigation, geography, and the complex historical relationships between Europe and the Americas. Many communities organize special events that feature period costumes, replicas of Columbus's ships, and traditional Italian music and cuisine, creating a rich cultural experience that bridges the past and present.</p>
