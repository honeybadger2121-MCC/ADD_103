            <h2>Exploring Nature's Playground</h2>
            <p>There's something magical about <strong>stepping into the wilderness</strong> and leaving the digital world behind, even temporarily.</p>

        <!-- Why I Hike -->
        <section class="hiking-benefits">
            <h2>Why I Hike</h2>
            <p><strong>Hiking grounds me</strong> in ways that no other activity can. After spending days solving complex technology problems, hitting the trail provides the perfect mental reset. It's where I reconnect with nature, challenge myself physically, and gain fresh perspectives on life's challenges.</p>
            
            <h3>Benefits I experience:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mental clarity and stress relief</li>
                <li>Physical fitness and endurance building</li>
                <li>Problem-solving in natural environments</li>
                <li>Appreciation for environmental conservation</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Trail Experiences -->
        <section class="trail-experiences">
            <h2>My Favorite Trail Experiences</h2>
            <p>I gravitate toward <strong>moderate to challenging trails</strong> that offer scenic rewards without requiring technical climbing skills. There's nothing quite like reaching a summit after a steady climb and seeing the landscape spread out below.</p>
            
            <h3>What I look for:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Well-maintained trail systems</li>
                <li>Diverse terrain and elevation changes</li>
                <li>Wildlife viewing opportunities</li>
                <li>Photography-worthy vistas</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Hiking Philosophy -->
        <section class="philosophy">
            <h2>Essential Hiking Philosophy</h2>
            <p>I follow <strong>Leave No Trace principles</strong> religiously. The wilderness we enjoy today must be preserved for future adventurers. Every hike is an opportunity to practice environmental stewardship while pursuing personal growth through physical challenge.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Trail safety is paramount</strong>—proper preparation, weather awareness, and respect for natural hazards ensure that every adventure ends safely.</p>
