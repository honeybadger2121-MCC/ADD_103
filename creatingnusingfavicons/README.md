   - Upload to public_html/creatingnusingfavicons/images/ (for specific site use)

2. File Structure After Deployment:
```
public_html/
├── favicon.ico                     # Site-wide favicon
└── creatingnusingfavicons/
    ├── index.html
    └── images/
        └── favicon.ico            # Page-specific favicon
```

3. Verify Setup:
   - Favicon appears in browser tab
   - Both favicon locations are accessible
   - HTML link tag points to correct location

## Testing
- Clear browser cache or use private window if favicon doesn't appear immediately
- Use Ctrl+F5 for hard refresh
- Verify favicon appears in different browsers

## HTML Implementation
The following line has been added to the `<head>` section:
```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.ico">
```
