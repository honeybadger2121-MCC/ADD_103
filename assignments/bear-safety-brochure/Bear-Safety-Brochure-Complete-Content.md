## PROTECT OUR BEARS
### BE A RESPONSIBLE VISITOR

**"A Fed Bear is a Dead Bear"**

When bears become habituated to human food:
- They lose their natural fear of humans
- They become aggressive and dangerous
- They must be relocated or euthanized

### YOUR ACTIONS MATTER
Every visitor plays a crucial role in bear conservation and human safety.

### VISIT RESPONSIBLY
- Follow all regulations
- Respect wildlife viewing distances
- Keep Grand Teton wild for future generations
