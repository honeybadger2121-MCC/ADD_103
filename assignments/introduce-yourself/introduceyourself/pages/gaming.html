                    <h3>My Gaming Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>Gaming isn't just entertainment for me – it's a way to challenge my strategic thinking, connect with friends, and explore incredible virtual worlds. As someone who spends their days solving IT problems, I appreciate games that require tactical planning, resource management, and creative problem-solving.</p>
                    
                    <p>My gaming journey spans decades, from early PC games to modern AAA titles. I particularly enjoy games that tell compelling stories, offer meaningful choices, and reward strategic thinking over quick reflexes.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Favorite Gaming Genres</h3>

                <h3>Balance in Digital and Physical Worlds</h3>
                <p>Gaming complements my outdoor activities perfectly. While hiking gives me physical challenges and natural beauty, gaming provides mental stimulation and social connection. Both activities teach patience, strategy, and the value of persistent effort toward long-term goals.</p>
                <p>The problem-solving skills I use in my IT career translate wonderfully to both gaming challenges and trail navigation. Whether I'm debugging a network issue, planning a difficult hike, or strategizing in a complex game, the core skills remain the same: analyze the situation, consider options, and execute a well-thought-out plan.</p>
