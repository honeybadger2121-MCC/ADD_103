                    <h3>My Hiking Journey</h3>
                    <p>Hiking has become more than just a hobby for me – it's a way to disconnect from the digital world and reconnect with nature. There's something profoundly peaceful about the rhythm of footsteps on a trail, the fresh mountain air, and the stunning vistas that await at every turn.</p>
                    
                    <p>I started hiking as a way to stay active and quickly discovered it was the perfect antidote to long days spent troubleshooting IT issues. The physical challenge combined with the mental clarity that comes from being in nature has made hiking an essential part of my life.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Favorite Hiking Destinations</h3>
                    <ul class="hiking-list">
                        <li><strong>Local Mountain Trails:</strong> My go-to weekend escape with varying difficulty levels</li>
                        <li><strong>State Park Systems:</strong> Well-maintained trails with incredible biodiversity</li>
                        <li><strong>Coastal Hiking Routes:</strong> Where mountains meet the ocean - breathtaking views</li>

                    <h3>Hiking Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>I believe in sustainable hiking practices that preserve the natural beauty for future generations. This means following Leave No Trace principles, staying on designated trails, and respecting wildlife habitats. Every hike is an opportunity to practice mindfulness and appreciate the incredible natural world around us.</p>
